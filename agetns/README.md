## ðŸ“‚ Agent Files

Each agent is defined in its own `.yaml` file, containing:

- A short identity and mission
- A `persona_prompt` for roleplay-based reasoning
- Skills, examples, and contextual file bindings
- Rules that govern behavior and quality

> See examples like `Forge.yaml`, `Quill.yaml`, etc. to get started creating your own.

## âœ¨ Want to add your own agent?

1. Copy one of the existing `.yaml` files as a template.
2. Define a new `id`, `title`, and `persona_prompt`.
3. Specify the skills, file_context, rules, and examples.
4. Reference your agent in a project by adding it to `project.yaml`.
