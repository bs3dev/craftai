# 🎨 Branding Guidelines

> This document defines the strategic and visual identity of the product.  
> It ensures consistent, recognizable, and emotionally resonant design across all user touchpoints — digital or human.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

To align every interaction — from product interface to marketing — with a coherent brand identity.  
This is the visual and symbolic language that communicates who we are, what we value, and how we behave.

---

## 🧠 Used by Agents

- **Nova**: UI architecture, design language, component behavior
- **Quill**: Verbal consistency and tone reflection
- **Pulse**: Strategic alignment of brand with product value

---

## 🧬 Brand DNA

- **Mission**: [What impact do we want to have on the world?]
- **Vision**: [What future are we building toward?]
- **Values**: [What do we believe in and never compromise?]

*Example:*  
> “We empower humans through clarity and autonomy — fighting complexity with design.”

## 🧠 Brand Personality

Define your brand as if it were a person. This is key to defining tone, UI behavior, and visual storytelling.

- Visionary but practical  
- Bold but humble  
- Rebellious but disciplined  
- Empathetic but direct  

*Agents will reflect this in interfaces, copy, and structure.*

- Maintain minimum contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Typography

## 🎯 Emotional Consistency

Design is not only how it looks, but how it feels.  
Define emotional tone per layer of interaction:

| Layer                  | Desired Emotion     |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Onboarding             | Curiosity + Safety  |
| Primary CTA (e.g. pay) | Confidence          |
| Error or fallback      | Empathy + Recovery  |
| Success / feedback     | Celebration + Clarity|

> Emotional alignment = brand trust + user connection
