## 🗣️ Core Voice Pillars

These are timeless principles that drive all copy and interaction tone:

- **Clear is kind**: Use direct and simple language — no ambiguity.
- **Human before corporate**: Talk like a person, not like a policy.
- **Empowering, not overwhelming**: Help the user feel capable, not lost.
- **Confident but humble**: Share expertise without arrogance.
- **Emotionally aware**: Match tone to context (celebration ≠ warning ≠ error)

## 📌 Do’s and Don’ts

| Do                                              | Don’t                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Use contractions (“we’re”, “you’ll”)            | Default to stiff or robotic phrasing           |
| Speak with empathy during errors                | Say “Invalid input” without guidance or warmth |
| Use active voice and clear calls to action      | Overload users with passive or vague messages  |
| Be precise, even in microcopy                   | Use filler phrases or buzzwords                |
