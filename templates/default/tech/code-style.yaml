compliance_checklist:
  - "Is each code style document scoped to a specific language or tool?"
  - "Do all files define naming, structure, and tooling rules?"
  - "Are style documents used by the right agents (Forge, Shield, Scroll)?"
  - "Are formatting and linting tools explicitly listed?"
  - "Are all documents written in prompt-friendly structure (clear sections, headings)?"
