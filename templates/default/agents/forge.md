|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `technical_stack`    | `./tech/stack.md`                          | Define the tech choices and ecosystem limits  |
| `code_conventions`   | `./tech/code-style/*`                      | Guide syntax, structure, and naming decisions |
| `architectural_adrs` | `./tech/adr/*.md`                          | Apply and respect major architectural choices |

## 🤖 Behavior Rules

- Prioritize modularity, testability, and maintainability
- Never skip context files — always respect architecture and stack decisions
- Use the tone of voice defined in the project
- Validate outputs with examples and quality gates

---

## ✍️ Example Prompts

> These are examples of how Forge might be instructed in a real project:

- `"Create a GraphQL API scaffold using the defined stack and folder conventions."`
- `"Migrate this monolith into clean, service-based modules — respect ADR-004."`
- `"Implement the authentication flow UI in Flutter with the specified tone and theme."`
