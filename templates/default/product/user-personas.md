# 👤 User Personas

> This document defines the key user personas for whom the product is designed.  
> Personas represent realistic archetypes that help teams and agents make user-centered decisions across product, content, design, and technical implementation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To align the entire team — including autonomous agents — around a shared understanding of who the users are, what they need, and how they behave.

---

## 🧠 Used by Agents

- **Focus**: to align features and strategy with real user needs
- **Pulse**: to map metrics to user behavior and outcomes
- **Echo**: to guide UX tone and emotional context
- **Forge**: to shape flows, components, and decision branches

---

## 👥 Persona Format

Each persona includes:

- `Name` (fictional but consistent)
- `Description` (who they are)
- `Goals` (what they want to achieve)
- `Frustrations` (what blocks them)
- `Behaviors` (how they act or decide)
- `Tools / Channels` (where they interact)
- `AI Opportunities` (how agents can help them)
