# CraftAI

**Build with soul. Code with intelligence.**  
A human–AI framework to build software like craftwork — with speed, precision, and artistry.

---

## ✨ What is CraftAI?

CraftAI is a framework for building software with **hybrid teams** — made of humans and AI agents working in symphony.  
Inspired by the creative renaissance of developers in the age of AI, CraftAI redefines coding as a craft, not a factory line.

Instead of replacing humans, we empower them to **orchestrate intelligent agents** that execute, reason, and ship code with autonomy and reliability.

> Imagine GitHub Copilot — but extended across the entire software lifecycle.

## 🎯 Why CraftAI?

- 🤝 **Human–AI Collaboration**: Agents that read natural instructions, open PRs, write tests, and ship features.
- ⚙️ **Composable Architecture**: Define modular agents for tech, content, strategy, data, and more.
- ⏱️ **Speed with Quality**: Deliver high-velocity code without compromising the art of building.
- 📐 **Opinionated but Extensible**: Grounded in best practices, but adaptable to your team or product.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Agent** | An autonomous unit that follows structured behavior (defined in Markdown or JSON). |
| **Orchestrator** | The human (you) who delegates and validates agent actions. |
| **Playbook** | A set of tasks agents can perform (e.g., refactor, test, document). |
| **Execution Engine** | The runtime that reads agent instructions and applies them to your repo. |

## 📦 Getting Started

> Coming soon: `npx craftai` and a full agent execution engine.

While that’s in progress, here’s what you can explore:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bs3dev/craftai.git
cd craftai
```

- Browse the [`agents/`](./agents) folder to see example agent definitions
- Read [`CRAFTAI.md`](./CRAFTAI.md) for architectural philosophy
- Check [`examples/`](./examples) for real-world usage

---

## 🛠 Example Use Cases

- ✨ Generate a landing page from a one-line prompt
- 🔍 Refactor legacy code using architectural constraints
- 🧪 Write and run unit tests for a newly pushed PR
- 📚 Auto-document internal tools or APIs

---

## 📐 Philosophy

CraftAI is built on the belief that:
- Software is a **creative endeavor**.
- Developers should spend more time **designing systems**, not pushing syntax.
- AI is not a tool — it’s a **teammate**.

If you believe in building with intention, intelligence, and soul — this is your framework.
