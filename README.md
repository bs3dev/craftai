# 🧠 CraftAI

**Build with soul. Code with intelligence.**  
A human–AI framework to build software like craftwork — with speed, precision, and artistry.

---

## ✨ What is CraftAI?

CraftAI is a framework for building software with **hybrid teams** — made of humans and AI agents working in symphony.  
Inspired by the creative renaissance of developers in the age of AI, CraftAI redefines coding as a craft, not a factory line.

Instead of replacing humans, we empower them to **orchestrate intelligent agents** that execute, reason, and ship code with autonomy and reliability.

> Imagine GitHub Copilot — but extended across the entire software lifecycle.

## 🎯 Why CraftAI?

- 🤝 **Human–AI Collaboration**: Agents that read natural instructions, open PRs, write tests, and ship features.
- ⚙️ **Composable Architecture**: Define modular agents for tech, content, strategy, data, and more.
- ⏱️ **Speed with Quality**: Deliver high-velocity code without compromising the art of building.
- 📐 **Opinionated but Extensible**: Grounded in best practices, but adaptable to your team or product.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Agent** | An autonomous unit that follows structured behavior (defined in YAML + Markdown). |
| **Orchestrator** | The human (you) who delegates and validates agent actions. |
| **Disciplines** | Files that provide context: product vision, branding, stack, UX, etc. |
| **Project** | A configuration file (`project.yaml`) that activates a squad of agents on a mission. |

## 📦 Getting Started

> Coming soon: `npx craftai` and a full agent execution engine.

While the execution engine is in development, you can explore the framework manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bs3dev/craftai.git
cd craftai
```

Then:

* 📁 Navigate to templates/default/ to see the full agent setup and discipline templates
* 📁 Copy projects/your-project and rename it to start your own mission
* ✍️ Edit the project.yaml file to activate agents and link contextual files
* 🧠 Call agents through your preferred LLM (e.g. GPT-4, Claude) and prompt execution manually

📁 Example Use Cases

* ✨ Generate a landing page from a one-line prompt
* 🔍 Refactor legacy code using architectural constraints
* 🧪 Write and run unit tests for a newly pushed PR
* 📚 Auto-document internal tools or APIs

📐 Philosophy

CraftAI is built on the belief that:
* Software is a creative endeavor.
* Developers should spend more time designing systems, not pushing syntax.
* AI is not a tool — it’s a teammate.

If you believe in building with intention, intelligence, and soul — this is your framework.
